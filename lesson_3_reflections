When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share code or you want more availability of your code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
GitHub is public and you may not want all the intermediate changes to be public.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches are part of repository. - Testing features on a project.
Clones are just copies of the repository. - Getting local copies of the repository to work on it.
Forks are also copies of the repository, but on GitHub.
- Give proper attribution to the person who wrote the code and then easily getting the code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Helps us track if we are working on anything that needs to be updated to the remote copy.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Easier - No need to learn git/GitHub
Harder - Tracking all the changes.
         Assigning fixes to specific person.
         Making changes that are compatible.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
All the time when you're collaborating. Helps others know what changes I have made and see their views on it.
