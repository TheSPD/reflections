When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share code or you want more availability of your code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
GitHub is public and you may not want all the intermediate changes to be public.
