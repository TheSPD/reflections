How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Diff gave me the line number of each change and narrowed the scope for me.
With that I was quickly able to find the typo.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Return to the version that works in case a mistake breaks the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Commits on Milestones would be better. If multiple useless commits are
    present then most of the versions would not even compile.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The files are dependent on one another in a coding project. Whereas, in a
    doc it does not matter.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log can be used to see all the commits
    git diff can be used to compare 2 different commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We can return to the version that was working.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For interview practice.
